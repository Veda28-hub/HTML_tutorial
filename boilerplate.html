<!--BOILERPLATE : MEANS THE STANDARD IN WHICH A HTML CODE IS RAN
think of it like a leave letter format in which html should be written
there are several things that are needed for this 

DOCTYPE: TELLS US THE VERSION OF THE HTML THAT WE'RE USING-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
</DOCTYPE>

<!-- HTML TAG : defines the whole HTML document.
everything that we code should be inside this html tag
Without it, the browser wouldn’t know where your page starts and ends.
Everything — headings, paragraphs, images, links, scripts, styles — goes inside it.
• Without it, the browser might not interpret your code properly.-->

<html>
</html>

<!--TITLE : DEFINES THE TITLE OF THE WEBPAGE
• The title appears in the browser tab and in search engine results.-->

<title>veda</title>

<!-- HEAD TAG : <head> — the “setup room”
	•	Contains information about the page that users don’t see directly.
	•	Think of it as the instructions, tools, and settings for your webpage.

What goes in <head>
	•	<title> → browser tab name
	•	<meta> → charset, viewport, description, SEO info
	•	<link> → CSS stylesheets, icons, fonts
	•	<script> → JavaScript files (sometimes in <body> too)-->

<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.jpeg">
</head>

<!-- BODY TAG :  <body> — why it’s needed
	•	Holds all the content users see and interact with.
	•	Without it:
	•	Your page would be blank for visitors.
	•	CSS and JavaScript wouldn’t know which elements to style or manipulate.

In short: <body> is the visible part of your webpage. It’s what people actually see.
<body> → for everything the user sees and interacts with:
	•	Headings (<h1>…<h6>)
	•	Paragraphs (<p>)
	•	Images (<img>)
	•	Links (<a>)
	•	Lists, buttons, forms, videos, etc.-->

<body>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
</body>

<!-- LINK TAG : connect your webpage to external resources, most commonly CSS stylesheets.-->

<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
